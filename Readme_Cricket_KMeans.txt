KMeans Clustering

Cricket Player Performance Dataset:
This dataset provides performance statistics for 79 cricket players, including various metrics over their careers. It can be used to cluster players based on similar performance characteristics, which is helpful for identifying groups of players with similar styles or levels of success.

Dataset Description:
The dataset includes the following columns:

Player: Name of the player.
Span: Active years of the player's career.
Mat: Number of matches played.
Inns: Number of innings played.
NO: Number of times the player remained not out.
Runs: Total runs scored by the player.
HS: Highest score achieved in a single inning.
Ave: Batting average (runs per inning, adjusted for not-outs).
BF: Balls faced across all innings.
SR: Strike rate (runs scored per 100 balls faced).
100: Number of centuries (100+ runs in an inning).
50: Number of half-centuries (50â€“99 runs in an inning).
0: Number of times the player was dismissed for zero runs ("duck").

Purpose of Clustering:

Using KMeans clustering on this dataset can help identify patterns in player performance, such as:
Grouping players with similar run-scoring abilities or playing styles.
Identifying clusters that reflect different batting roles or levels of consistency.
This analysis is valuable for performance assessment, talent scouting, and understanding player profiles in a more quantitative manner.
